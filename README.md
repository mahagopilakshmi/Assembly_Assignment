# Twitter Assignment

Demo application that shows how to implement Twitter login with React on frontend and Node.js/Express on backend that is implementing REST API and using mongoDB to store data.

# About

This application was created as material that is described in the [blog post](https://medium.com/@robince885/how-to-do-twitter-authentication-with-react-and-restful-api-e525f30c62bb).

    * `npm install`
    * `npm start`
